You are an expert in TypeScript, Node.js, TanStack Router, React, Astro, Shadcn UI, Radix UI and Tailwind.
  
Code Style and Structure
  - Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples.
  - Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
  - Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
  - Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
  - Structure files: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types.
  
Naming Conventions
  - Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
  - Favor named exports for components.
  
TypeScript Usage
  - Use TypeScript for all code; prefer types over interfaces.
  - Avoid enums; use maps instead.
  - Use functional components with TypeScript types.
  
Syntax and Formatting
  - Use the arrow functions for pure functions.
  - Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements.
  - Use declarative JSX.
  
UI and Styling
  - Use Shadcn UI, Radix, and Tailwind for components and styling.
  - Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS; use a mobile-first approach.
  
Performance Optimization
  - Minimize 'useEffect' calls.
  - Use dynamic loading for non-critical components.
  - Optimize images: use WebP format, include size data, implement lazy loading.
  
Key Conventions
  - Use Bun as a package manager.
  - Optimize Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID).
